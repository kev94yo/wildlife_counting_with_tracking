# This is a project based on iWildcam 2021 - FGVC8
The task of this project is to count the number of animals of each species present in a sequence of images.
Data is omitted in this repository due to size issues, and can be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/iwildcam2021-fgvc8/data).
Store the downloaded data in a folder named data in the base directory to successfully run the notebooks and py files in this repository.
